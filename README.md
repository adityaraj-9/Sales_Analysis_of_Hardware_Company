### Total Sales Revenue & Sales Quantity:
Sales Revenue: ₹984.81 million.
Sales Quantity: 2 million units sold.

This section gives stakeholders a quick snapshot of the overall sales performance during the selected period.


### Revenue by Market:

Displays the sales revenue generated across different markets.
Delhi NCR is top in revenue contribution, accounting for over 500 million, while smaller markets like Bengaluru and Patna contribute minimal sales. It highlights which regions to focus on for maximizing returns or improving underperforming markets.

### Sales Quantity by Market:

Displays the quantity of products sold in each market.
The high sales quantity in Delhi NCR aligns with its high revenue. However, markets like Nagpur and Kochi show high quantities sold relative to their revenue, indicating potential for optimizing pricing strategies in those regions.

### Revenue Trend:

Line graph showing the sales revenue trends over time from 2017 to early 2020.
Sales peaked several times, in 2018 and 2019, with a decline in 2020. These fluctuations is alligning with covid-19 pandemic.

### Top 5 Customers:

Lists the top customers based on the sales revenue generated.
A small number of customers account for significant revenue. Electricalsara Stores contributes far more than the others, making it a key customer. However, we need to make more high contributing clients because  reliance on a few large customers can be a risk to revenue stability.

### Top 5 Products (Bottom Right):

Displays the top products by sales revenue.
The large revenue from the “Blank” product indicates a data quality issue that requires further clarification. Resolving this issue is critical for more accurate product-level information. Among other products, Prod040, Prod159, and Prod065 contribute relatively similar amounts between 15 million to 23 million.

### Date Range Filters:

Allows filtering by different periods between 2017 and 2020, offering flexibility for time-based analysis.
These filters enable stakeholders to analyze sales performance over specific periods to identify trends or evaluate the impact of campaigns and strategies.

## Conclusion
The dashboard provides a clear and actionable view of sales performance across various markets, products, and customer segments. While overall sales are strong, there are key areas that require attention, such as data quality, customer diversification, and market-specific strategies. With the help of these insights Atliq Hardware can sustain and grow its business in a competitive environment.
